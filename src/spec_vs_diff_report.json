  "summary": "The diff adds a deployment retry script, a wrapper to capture full stdout/stderr to timestamped log files, and accompanying documentation. However, it does not provide evidence of actually re-running/triggering a build+deploy for the current revision in CI or ensuring the deployment succeeds and the app is reachable. Additionally, there are backend (and apparent broader frontend/admin) changes that look unrelated to deployment retry/log capture, which violates the stated constraint/non-goals.",

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Re-run the full build and deployment process for the current application revision (frontend + backend) and ensure it completes successfully.",
      "reason": "The diff provides scripts/docs to run deployment commands manually, but does not show any actual build/deploy execution result, CI/CD trigger, or changes that would ensure the deployment completes successfully and the app is reachable post-deploy.",
